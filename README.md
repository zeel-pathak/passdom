We use passwords daily.But did we have any good way to store passwords.
For web we have browsers to store password, but what about CLI, terminals.

passdom is here for help.

It takes less than 10 second to store your password and less than a second to retrieve them. You can store passwords for multiple websites and tools.

* Finding of credentials should be made more easy.
* Extra flags should be added to help and made it easy to use as well as a flag to list all credentials.
* Should ask again for confirmation while removing.
